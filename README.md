The KTM Booking System is a train ticketing system developed to facilitate the booking of train tickets and provide information about train schedules for the users. 
This system allows users to make booking between any of the 15 stations within a 7 days timeframe. 
In terms of security, this system does encryption for every staff information to protect their personal information from any unauthorized personnel. Multiple ways and combinations of encryption methods are used such as Caesar Cipher, XOR Cipher and Reverse Cipher. A different and unique Encryption Key is used to encrypt every information input into the system to prevent repetition and increase the complexity of the encrypted information. Thus, it is theoretically impossible to crack and bypass the encryption. This prevents the leakage of information when any system breach happens.
The staff and administrator have full access to the system to make edits and maintenance for every information about train schedules, member and staff information, ticket information and train information. 
The members only have access to their own information after they login. After login, members can make edits to their information, check the train schedule, make a booking of the ticket and check their ticket status.
